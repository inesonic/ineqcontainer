ineqcontainer
=============
The ineqcontainer library provides a Qt wrapper for the
`inecontainer <https://github.com/inesonic/inecontainer>` library bringing
inecontainer into the Qt framework.

The library uses the qmake build tool and depends on the inecontainer
library.  Use the ``INECONTAINER_INCLUDE`` and ``INECONTAINER_LIBDIR``
variables to tell qmake where the inecontainer library is located.
